# rudash

It's the Titanium Dashboard / three 20 launcher wrapper code pulled out and
dropped into a module. Use it like the standard dashboard view:

```javascript

var RuDash = require('edu.rutgers.dash');

var dashboard = RuDash.createDashboardView();
// etc

```

Apache 2 since that's what Ti is under
